## pagination to asp classic

I liked this variant more than datatables (included in previous folder).  

The version attached is [boostrap-table](https://github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table) **v1.3.0** (2014).  

tested&working on IE11.

more options on this [file](https://github.com/pipiscrew/fb_organizer/blob/master/src/tab_dashboard_seller_paid_list.php), snoop around you will find more files containing other properties..  

search for
```
data-response-handler
data-query-params
proposalFormatter
```

saying because the doc is updated and most probably settings are not maintained.
