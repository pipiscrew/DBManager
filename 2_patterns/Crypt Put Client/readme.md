### Add a security layer to server to server requests

This package add a security layer to server to server requests.

It can work with both Request and Response PSR-7 compliant objects by implementing security features like:

- Works with both Request and Response objects (PSR-7)
- Shared-key encryption
- Shared-key authentication
- Anonymous public-key encryption
- Public-key digital signatures
- Sends and receives signed or encrypted JSON
- Digital signatures and authentication are backwards-compatible with unsigned JSON API clients and servers
- The signaure and authentication tag will go into HTTP headers, rather than the request and response body
